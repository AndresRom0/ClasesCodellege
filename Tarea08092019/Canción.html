<h1>On Melancholy Hill</h1>
<h2>By Gorillaz</h2>
<br>Up on melancholy hill<br>There's a plastic tree<br>Are you here with me<br>Just looking out on the day<br>Of another dream</br>
<br>Well you can´t get what you want<br>But you can get me<br>So let´s set out to sea<br>'Cause you are my medicine<br>When you are close to me<br>When you're close to me</br>
<br>So call in the submarines<br>'Round the world will go<br>Does anybody know her?<br>If we're looking out on the day<br>Of another dream</br>
